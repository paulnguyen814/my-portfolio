    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Paul Nguyen, I am a 26 year-old student currently attending Humber College. I am in the Computer Programming
    program, and I am excited to be here! This is my first time ever diving into the programming world.
    I was previously attending Wilfrid Laurier University back in 2017 for Biochemistry, and it took some time for me to
    realize that it wasn't for me. I took a break from school to figure out what I wanted to do, and i thought, why not pursue something
    I was interested in? So here I am! ☺️
